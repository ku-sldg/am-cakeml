# Tests

This folder contains some tests and demo scripts to run.

## [Demo.sh](./Demo.sh)

This script will run a demo script (where one of the flexible mechanisms can be chosen) to run.

### Prerequisities

- `tmux`
- POSIX Shell

To close the tmux script, make sure you close all `tmux` panes using `PREFIX + x` where the prefix is typically (Ctrl + b)
(To kill all tmux panes at once, type 'tmux kill-server' in one of the open panes)
